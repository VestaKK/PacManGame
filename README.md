This repository stores some java code I did for a subject called Software Modelling and Design. 
The majority of the subject's projects involved heavy refactoring of an initial codebase to make 
the final game easier to understand and more extensible, using a variety of GRASP principles and
GoF design patterns.

Each project has a documentation folder and a pacman folder. The documentation folder contains 
a report and some UML diagrams (design and domain) to help understand the structure of the codebase, 
as well as some reasoning behind the refactored elements. The pacman folder contains the actual
game (Project 1) and game editor (Project 2), which both start their execution from Driver.java.
